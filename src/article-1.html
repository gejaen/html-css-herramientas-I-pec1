        <p>It’s been a whopping 25 years since Friends first premiered in September 1994, but fans of the hit series are
          no less fond of the six New York pals who helped define an era. And now, loyal Friends viewers will get the
          chance to revisit some of the show’s most iconic spaces with an interactive pop-up experience coming to New
          York City this fall.</p>

        <p>In addition to the legendary Central Perk coffee shop (including its iconic orange couch, of course), the
          pop-up will feature walk-through replicas of Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston)’s apartment,
          Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc)’s apartment, and even the infamous Central Park fountain from
          the series’ opening credits, explained Warner Bros. in a press release. Visitors are advised to be
          Instagram-ready to snap photos of themselves with a turkey on their heads à la Joey in that one Thanksgiving
          episode, or carrying a sofa up a narrow flight of stairs like Ross (David Schwimmer) did on moving day. Other
          fun interactive elements include peeking through Rachel and Monica’s door into their purple apartment and
          kicking back in Joey and Chandlers’ recliners (chick and duck not included).</p>

        <p>“It’s been nearly 25 years since Friends premiered, but the fascination and universal appeal of the hit TV
          series lives on with fans of all ages. As we celebrate the show’s milestone anniversary, we are excited to
          bring the Friends experience to life for our fans in a way that pays homage to the remarkable cast of
          characters, iconic sets and instantly quotable moments,” said Peter van Roden, SVP at Warner Bros. Consumer
          Products. Tickets for the pop-up, which will be located in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, will go on sale
          Friday, August 2, and the special experience will run from September 7 through October 6.</p>

        <p>For fans who might not be able to make it to the Big Apple, there are plenty of other ways to celebrate the
          show’s 25th anniversary, including a GIF channel that Warner Bros. is launching in partnership with Giphy,
          which will include a whopping 2,300 GIFs from every single episode of the series’ 10 seasons. Pottery Barn
          also launched a Friends-inspired furniture line earlier this month.</p>
